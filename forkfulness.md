# Decentral Bank Forkfulness 

The Decentral Bank Network (DBN) is a set of bank branches (smart contracts) among many distributed ledgers which the equity holders decide to accept assets on. Because of this, it is important to clearly define the forkfulness properties of such a network. 

The DBN is much more resistant to forks to its network than most distributed ledger networks because it is one of the first inter-ledger protocols, meaning that the network itself encompasses on potentially many chains with their own Byzantine consensus rules. 

On the contrary, this also means that respective ledgers can fork their networks without direct input from decentral bank equity holders and users.
