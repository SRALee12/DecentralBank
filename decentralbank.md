## Abstract

Current stablility-centric cryptocurrency projects focus on one central mechanism within the network to control the purchasing power of the stable token. Usually this involves a method to control the expansion or retraction of a stable currency unit through offering of a volatile asset that has the potential for upside and downside of the network. Decentral bank uniquely offers multiple stability mechanisms to enact monetary policy on its issued currency tokens. Each stability mechanism uniquely decouples different volatility and investment risk allowing for a system of credit, debt, asset backing, bond investment, and equity investment opportunities for creating a stable currency. This allows the decentral bank network a multitude of ways for both expanding and contracting currency supply as well as backing the currency with assets, credit, and debt - all in a decentralized and trustless network.  


## Definitions 

**Decentral bank:** A peer-to-peer network which prints a stable currency and conducts a variety of trustless, on-chain open market operations through different algorithmic stability mechanisms.  

**Currency:** A token which serves as a unit of account and medium of exchange printed by decentral bank. The network expands and contracts the currency supply to keep the currency at a stable purchasing power, similar to classical banknotes, so that they can be used as practical money. All currency is fungible.   

**Bond:** A debt instrument printed by decentral bank which can be purchased with currency. Bonds are printed to retract the currency supply. The bond pays out a denominated amount at a fixed interval (the coupon) to its holder.

**Decentral equity:** A token in the decentral bank network which gives right of proportional ownership to holders. The equity tokens the base unit of the decentral bank blockchain. Equity holders have governance say by partaking in the consensus method of the chain. Equity tokens can be printed in exchange for currency to retract supply. Equity holders can decide how to allocate the transaction fees of the network. 

**Stability mechanism:** A particular scheme used to exert monetary policy so that currency tokens remain stable. Usually a stability mechanism is a scheme for either contracting the currency supply, backing the currency tokens with collateral, or market making the currency at a defined price range. 

**Fork choice rule:** A set of instructions for choosing the canonical chain of blocks of a particular blockchain database. In the decentral bank network, the canonical chain is the chain of blocks defined by the proof of stake method which decentral equity tokens partake in. 

## Overview

A decentral bank is a completely "on-chain" (residing on a distributed ledger platform) network which employs a large number of stability mechanisms to exert maximum leverage on manipulating the currency supply which it prints. Decentral bank is novel in a number of ways compared to current "stablecoin" and stability-focused cryptocurrency projects. Firstly, decentral bank separates risks so that there are multiple volatile assets in the system which are able to exert different monetary policy.

The decentral bank network uses multiple modules that serve different functions in providing stability for the currency unit of the network. 

The bank has 3 main stability mechanisms used to retract currency supply. Firstly, the bank continuously sells decentral bank bond tokens purchasable with currency tokens. This destroys the currency tokens and pays back the holder of the bond token a coupon rate until maturity of the bond. This bond auction is always algorithmically available to purchasers and the network software adjusts the coupon rate and maturity date making the bonds more enticing as investments if necessary.

Secondly, the network auctions off currency for certain assets on different networks using cross-chain communication and holds those assets in smart contracts on their respective networks. For example, decentral bank could accept ETH on the Ethereum main network.

The type of assets that decentral bank can accept can be changed with a hard fork update to the client software which means 51% of the staking tokens (equity tokens) must accept such an update.

Lastly, decentral bank can auction of newly created equity tokens for currency to take currency out of circulation. This is the final stability mechanism employed by decentral bank. Equity token auctions would be algorithmically activated if a large amount of currency must be retracted from the circulating supply in a certain time period.


## Stability Mechanisms 

### Collateralized Debt Mechanism

The Collateralized Debt Mechanism (CDM) allows anyone to send the decentral bank network  

### Bond Mechanism

The bond mechanism works as a classic bond auction. Bond tokens are printed and auctioned for currency in a reverse Dutch auction every T time period. To increase retractionary monetary policy through the bond mechanism, the network increases the interest rate of the bond tokens by a certain denominated amount.  

Holding a bond token pays out the holder a coupon rate in currency until the maturation of the bond. Bond tokens with the same maturation date and interest rate are fungible.


### Equity Mechanism

The equity mechanism prints new equity tokens and auctions them for currency in a reverse Dutch auction every R time period. All equity tokens are fungible with one another. The more equity tokens that are printed and auctioned for currency, the more retractionary policy on the currency tokens.

### Market Making Mechanism

The market making mechanism takes assets within the decentral bank network's smart contracts and creates buy orders for currency at the stability price range.

### Fractional Reserve Mechanism

The Fractional Reserve Mechanism (FRM) is a mechanism which allows the decentral bank network to auction of currency for assets.

## Fork Choice Rule as Governance

Decentral Bank equity holders control the implicit end-state of the network through their ability to hardfork the canonical chain should sufficient social consensus arise among equity token holders. Since certain stability mechanisms used by the decentral bank network hold cryptographic assets, the canonical chain retains control of such stored assets and thus keeps the network effect. 

## Mechanism Interactions

Because multiple stability mechanisms exist within the network, their interactions with each other are important in 

## Scalable, Plasma Cash Currency 

Decentral Bank should become the world's de facto currency-issuing bank. In such a world, the number of transactions required for the currency would be orders of magnitude larger than current distributed ledger can handle. For this reason, the Plasma Cash framework proposed by the Ethereum foundation would be an ideal scaling solution for purely fungible currency tokens. Secondly, "plasma chains" can be run by institutions with sufficient merkle proofs to the Decentral Bank main network. 

## Truly Private Currency 

Since decentral bank currency is a fungible token, it would be possible to integrate distributed ledger privacy features such as zero knowledge proofs which would allow for any user to exchange stable currency tokens without revealing their identity. Such zero knowledge proofs without a "set up" phase are still in development and are not widely available, but can be incoporated into the client software once software has advanced. 

## Transaction Fees

Movement of currency tokens, bond tokens, and equity on the decentral bank network requires transaction fees. In a proof of stake based consensus mechanism, the equity tokens are the staking token and take part in the block proposal and finality process. Thus, equity holders that stake their tokens recieve the revenue accrued from transaction fees from users. 

## Comparisons, Criticisms, and Alternatives

Decentral bank is a network of banks which print currency and accrue assets to expand and retract the currency supply, thus achieving price stability. Other projects have proposed such price stability through expansion and retraction of a currency token. However, we believe that most leading projects are lacking in the ability to accrue assets to conduct meaningful open market operations similar to a traditional banking entity which issues its own currency. Without proper open market operations, the entire system is built on a faulty premise and foundation. 

There are an emerging class of algorithmic stable currency projects. Each of these systems usually hinge on a 2 token scheme. One token being the object of stabilization while the other token being the object of risk where the holder assumes liability for negative value in order to gain positive value of the system. This 2 token system first proposed by Robert Sams in 2014 is the essence of most algorithmic based stable currency projects. 

### Seigniorage Shares

Seigniorage shares is the seminal paper by Robert Sams in 2014 that describes the famous two token system of shares and coins. Coins being the object of stabilization and shares being the object of risk (with downside and upside potential). Sams explains: "When coin supply needs to increase, coinbase is distributed to share holders in exchange for a certain percentage of shares, which are destroyed (coin supply increases, share supply decreases). When coin supply needs to decrease, sharebase is distributed to coin holders in exchange for a certain percentage of coin, which are destroyed (coin supply decreases, share supply increases)."

Sams contends, "I suggest that there needs to be two types of coin: coin that acts like money and coin that acts like shares in the systemâ€™s  seigniorage." Seigniorage is defined as profit made by a government when they issue/sell/loan the currency which they print and bring into existence. What is interesting about Sams' scheme is that it cannot hold seigniorage. There is no actual way for this system to hold assets or any type of seigniorage that is attained by auctioning off newly printed coins. The main issue we take with this approach is that there cannot be a token which "acts like shares in the system's seigniorage" if the system is incapable of holding actual seigniorage. This token simply defaults to a future potential of return for an expansion in the system. What is interesting is that Sams clearly understands that the main attraction of the shares token is the "profit from future coin expansions" but does not address that a system with real seigniorage means that share tokens have substantially more utility and value. This is because the value of shares would no longer just be the profit of future currency expansions but profit from the increase in value of all assets owned by the system. This includes pricing in future expansions of currency as well as the assets held within the nework which was bought by currency at previous expansions. A system which can actually hold seigniorage is a system which can issue shares/equity of such seigniorage, not a system which is designed with the sole inability to hold seigniorage. 

The object of risk in the seigniorage shares system can only gain a positive value if the system expands. Conversely, decentral bank equity (the object of risk in our system) can gain a positive value if the net value of assets held in the system increases **and/or** the system needs to expand the currency supply. Thus, there is substantially more upside potential to the object of risk in the decentral bank system than seigniorage shares. 

### Basecoin/basis.io 

Basis is a project which has as of May 2018 raised $133m USD. The scheme has 3 tokens instead of 2. Basecoin/basiscoin is the object of stabilization. Basis bonds are the tokens of risk which are printed and auctioned off when coins need to retract in supply. Finally, baseshare tokens are merely investor tokens and serve no use in open market operations of the basis system. They are merely a tool to raise funds for the project (as evidenced by their large and successful funding round). So in reality, the economic scheme is almost identical to seigniorage shares and is actually a 2 token system.  

Bond tokens in the basis system are a misnomer. Bond tokens do not pay out a coupon or mature on a given date but instead pay out in a peculiar and unconventional first-in-first-out queue when the system expands the currency supply. Bond tokens are essentially seigniorage share tokens with a different name and payment distribution scheme. In practice, bond tokens are perhaps worth less than a seigniorage share - they are in effect just a put option. Even worse, unlike seigniorage shares, bond tokens are not fungible since they have a unique place in the first-in-first-out queue to be repaid. This further means that unlike seigniorage shares (or real government bonds), basis bond tokens are not listable on exchanges and trading pairs cannot form since each one is unique. There is an inability to form efficient basis bond markets which creates even further liquidity risk. 

Not only is this not how a traditional bond functions, it is intentionally (or maybe unintentionally) confusing users of the system into believing it has some kind of substantial similarity to central bank bonds. In fact, the **only** similarity basis bonds have with traditional bonds is that they are used for retraction of currency. All other similarities stop there. Calling basis bonds "bonds" is a misnomer at best or a marketing ploy at worst. Traditional bonds are riskless by definition. That is, the government will always pay the holder the face value of the bond since they can simply print currency to do it (even if the currency loses purchasing power because of such printing). Basis bonds have no such guarantee. In fact, they are the object of risk - a complete opposite utility to that of government bonds which are traidtionally thought of as "riskless by definition." 

Basis dubs itself as a "stable cryptocurrency with an algorithmic central bank." Basis is more akin to a currency with an empty central bank with no way to accrue a balance sheet of assets. The Basis scheme imitates a central bank with zero options when conducting open market operations but to sell bonds (which as we discussed above is not really a bond). Another way to describe basis is a stablecoin project backed by nothing except put options on basecoins itself. Ironically, this essentially makes basis an asset-backed project with the least robust asset backing system for the stable token. 


## Conclusion

Decentral bank offers any individual in the world reliable interest on deposited assets, access to a stable cryptographic currency with sound monetary policy, by-definition riskless bond coupons, and equity investment opportunities in the bank itself.
