This is an exhaustive list of cryptoeconomic mechanisms currently used for stability in tokenized units of account. 

**Tokenized IOU Coupons**
The original stability mechanism by simply holding 1:1 of the pegged asset and simply tokenizing it. Tether is a successful example. 

Pros: No other mechanism is needed to keep stability to a pegged asset. 

Cons: Requires trust to create IOU tokens of off-chain assets.

**Seigniorage Share/Seigniorage Equity**

The first true proposal for an asset-less stability mechanism. A seigniorage share represents equity in the future growth (future seigniorage) of the network that issues the stable tokens. During expansionary cycles, the share token holders can exchange their shares for stable tokens in an open auction. 

Pros: Does not require assets for stability mechanism. 

Cons: A seigniorage share only represents future growth (ie: future issuance) of more stable tokens and nothing else. It does not represent any other network asset or metric. Share holders get diluted as more is printed during expansionary cycles. 

**Basis Bond**

A token proposed in the basis.io system which is auctioned off to retract supply of the stable token. The "bond token" pays back exactly 1 stable token during an expansionary cycle. Bond token holders are paid out in a first in first out queue during expansionary cycles/ 

Pros: A very simple mechanism modeled after seigniorage shares. 

Cons: Doesn't behave similar to a classical "bond" in traditional banking. 

**Decentral Bank Coupon Bond**

**Decentral Market Making (market maker using deposited commercial funds)**

**Carbon Credit**

**Overcollaterized debt**

**Transaction fee burn/sinks**

**Stability fee sinks**
