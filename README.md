# DecentralBank
a peer-to-peer, permissionless central bank which provides a "monetary consitution" to a stable, depoliticized currency for the global market. 

For overall specifications, read the whitepaper DecentralBank.md. 

Current work is being done so that Decentral Bank Branch contracts support ETH and EOS ledgers with ETH and EOS as the first 2 assets accepted. Bank branch contract naming convention: {network_name}_{asset_name}_bank_branch

See corresponding folders for deployable smart contracts to each ledger.
